HOW IT WORKS

Tell us about your backyard (5 min.)

During our initial call we will discuss the location of your backyard, and determine if your spot is a good fit.

No cost, no-obligation home visit ((45 minutes))

On our visit, weâ€™ll answer any new questions you might have and take some measurements to determine where the tiny home will go.

Determine license or permits with your city (1-2 weeks)

We will work with the city to get the tiny house licensed, if in Denver. If elsewhere, more than likely, we will not need a permit.

Placement of Teeny House (1 day)

The Teeny Home arrives, and we connect the water (through a garden house) and electricity (with an extension cord). Both the electricity and the water are metered with our separate meters and we pay for the Teeny Home's utility consumption every month.

Listing of the Teeny Home (1 day)
We will take professional photos of the Teeny Home and it's immediate surrounding area and list on Airbnb.

Payment (2 weeks)
Please allow for two weeks for the first payment. Afterwards, the home should be consistently booked by solo and couple travelers.
