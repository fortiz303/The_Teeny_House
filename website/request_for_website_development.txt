Hello! I am seeking a wordpress/django/ract developer that can create a website for my startup. The landing page should be very simple. An example of what I want it to look like would be rentthebackyard.com or uniteddwelling.com. I don't have the domain registered now but I would like to get that registered and configured.

About the workflow: I want to work on this website together (and collaborating through GitHub), though I don't have much experience in creating websites. I'd like to learn how they are made and so I would like to ask you questions on discord or another simmilar work sharing software. Ideally, I would like to finish this site in a few days. I know it's a little but weird when working on a project on two different time zones, but it's definetely doable. Again, building this website the fastest we can is what I want to do.

A little more about the project: I don't have all the photos at the moment that I would like to add but we could add those later when those photos are ready.

Please send me some of your samples and we can go from there. Thank you and have a blessed day!
