HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH WASTEWATER?

The Teeny Home has a compostable toilet, and that eliminates the need for a black water tank. The Teeny Home has a shower, and the water from that is stored in a gray watetr tank attached to the bottom of the home. The tank usually takes three days to fill up, and has a sensor that communicates to us when it's getting close to being full. We responsibly dispose of the gray water.

Using Airbnb, and VRBO, we are able to set a filter to maximize the number of guests who can stay there at one point. The maximum amount of guests who will be allowed to stay at the Teeny House will be two.

CAN I VIEW THE TINY HOUSE?

We have a workshop in North Denver where we are constructing these tiny houses. Send us a message in the Contact Us form and we will get in touch regarding a viewing of our facility.

DO YOU PROVIDE BUSINESS INSURANCE?

In short, yes! Airbnb provides insurance which is called Host Protection Insurance and is a liability insurance program whenever a guest stays at the tiny house. It may provide up to $1,000,000 USD in liability coverage for a hostâ€™s legal responsibility to a guest or third party that gets hurt or has their property damaged due to an incident related to an Airbnb stay.
